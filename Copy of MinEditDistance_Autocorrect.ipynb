This will save a copy of this file in your Google Drive under the name Copy of <Original File Name>. Rename the file.\n","* Ensure you are logged into your msitprogram.net account when doing this.\n","\n","Work on Your Copy:\n","* Do not edit this original file.\n","* All your work must be done on the copy saved in your Google Drive. Any work done on this original file will not be saved and may be lost.\n","\n","Saving Your Work:\n","* Google Colab automatically saves your progress in the copy stored in your Drive. However, it's a good practice to manually save your work periodically by clicking on File > Save.\n","\n","\n","Let's get started!!!"],"id":"kVnX9T83poUj"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"afrkYJ9JpoUo"},"source":["## Table of Contents\n","- [0 - Overview](#0)\n","    - [0.1 - Edit Distance](#0-1)\n","- [1 - Data Preprocessing](#1)\n","    - [Exercise 1 - process_data](#ex-1)\n","    - [Exercise 2 - get_count](#ex-2)\n","    - [Exercise 3 - get_probs](#ex-3)\n","- [2 - String Manipulations](#2)\n","    - [Exercise 4 - delete_letter](#ex-4)\n","    - [Exercise 5 - switch_letter](#ex-5)\n","    - [Exercise 6 - replace_letter](#ex-6)\n","    - [Exercise 7 - insert_letter](#ex-7)\n","- [3 - Combining the Edits](#3)\n","    - [3.1 - Edit One Letter](#3-1)\n","        - [Exercise 8 - edit_one_letter](#ex-8)\n","    - [3.2 - Edit Two Letters](#3-2)\n","        - [Exercise 9 - edit_two_letters](#ex-9)\n","    - [3.3 - Suggest Spelling Suggestions](#3-3)\n","        - [Exercise 10 - get_corrections](#ex-10)\n","- [4 - Minimum Edit Distance](#4)\n","    - [4.1 - Dynamic Programming](#4-1)\n","        - [Exercise 11 - min_edit_distance](#ex-11)\n","- [5 - Backtrace](#5)"],"id":"afrkYJ9JpoUo"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"8mCDFdKnpoUo"},"source":["<a name='0'></a>\n","## 0 - Overview\n","\n","You use autocorrect every day on your cell phone and computer.
