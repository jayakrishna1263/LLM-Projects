indicate the beginning of the sentence.  \n","- For example, in the tri-gram model (n=3), a sequence with two start tokens \"<s\\>\" should predict the first word of a sentence.\n","- So, if the sentence is \"I like food\", modify it to be \"<s\\> <s\\> I like food\".\n","- Also prepare the sentence for counting by appending an end token \"</s\\>\" so that the model can predict when to finish a sentence.\n","\n","Technical note: In this implementation, you will store the counts as a dictionary.\n","- The key of each key-value pair in the dictionary is a **tuple** of n words (and not a list)\n","- The value in the key-value pair is the number of occurrences.  \n","- The reason for using a tuple as a key instead of a list is because a list in Python is a mutable object (it can be
